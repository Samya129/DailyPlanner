# DailyPlanner

    I was given starter code for a calendar application that allows a user to save events each hour of their work day. This application needed to run in the browser and feature updated HTML and CSS with jQuery. I used the Luxon and Moment library to work with dates and times. Even though Moment.js is popular but no longer supported, I wanted to implement both as a greater learning experience. With that said, I needed to execute creating a daily planner that would: 
    
    When opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When a user scrolls down, they are presented with a set of standard business hours. When a user views each time block, it is color-coded to indicate whether the event in the calendar is a past, present, or a future occurence. When a user clicks into each time block, they are able to enter an event and save when the user clicks the save button. When the save button is clicked, it is saved to local storage so that when the user comes back and refreshes the page, then the saved events are displayed for the user's use.


Applications used: 

    -HTML
    -CSS powered by jQuery

    -Moment.js
